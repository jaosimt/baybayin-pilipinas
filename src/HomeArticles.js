        description: 'Badlit script / Suwat Bisaya/Sulat Bisaya (Baybayin Bisaya) - is an Ancient pre-Filipino writing system, it\'s member of the Brahmic family and closely related to other writing system in Southeast Asia, Badlit is an Abugida or an alpha-syllabary writing system, like most writing system used in Southeast Asia, where any consonants is pronounced with a vowel and using a diacritical marks to express other vowels. It is written from left to right and requires no spaces between words, space is use only after end of a sentence or punctuation, although in modern writing it usually contains spaces after each word to enhance readability.\n' +

        description: 'There have been a few attempts to alter the original Baybayin for modern use. One of the first attempts to “reform” the Baybayin was in 1620 when Fr. Francisco Lopez was about to publish the Ilokano Doctrina. Seeing the “limitations” of Baybayin, he invented a new kudlit in the shape of a cross. When placed under a consonant, it would cancel the “a” vowel after the consonant.\n\nI personally don’t like it due to it’s colonial origins and overall artistic look but I do see the purpose of it putting my cultural preference aside. If you look at Baybayin as purely a writing system, this mutation is a natural process. Thanks a surge of Baybayin tattoos, the Spanish kudlit has made a comeback due people wanting a “complete” translation.'

It was the Spanish Empire and the lost alphabet was a script that is known today as the baybayin.\n\nContrary to the common misconception, when the Spaniards arrived in the islands they found more than just a loose collection of backward and belligerent tribes. They found a civilization that was very different from their own. The ability to read and write is the mark of any civilization and, according to many early Spanish accounts, the Tagalogs had already been writing with the baybayin for at least a century. This script was just beginning to spread throughout the islands at that time. Furthermore, the discovery in 1987 of an inscription on a sheet of copper in Laguna is evidence that there was an even more advanced script in limited use in the Philippines as far back as the year 900 C.E.\n\nThis language of ours is like any other, it once had an alphabet and its own letters that vanished as though a tempest had set upon a boat on a lake in a time now long gone.\n\nThe tempest in Rizal\'s verse struck the Philippines in the 16th century.
